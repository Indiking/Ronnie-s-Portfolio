<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Taking the time to learn new skills has always been one of my favorite things to do. This time I am taking a stab
  at web developement. Through the years of working on my creativity, it's always been a dream to create my own website
  for my clothing collections. I am in the beginning stages of learning how to do just that.</p>

<p>Feel free to critique my work and give me feedback on what could be better. I will be an open book to all criticism
  so that I can create the best possible web experiences for my clothing collections. Thank you for visiting my pages
  and I hope to hear from everyone. Love!</p>
